<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>As a software engineering student at SCE, I am eager to learn and apply the latest technologies and methodologies in the software industry. I have a solid foundation in data structures, OOP, design patterns, and architecture, and I am proficient in Python, Java, C++, and C. I also have experience in using Jira, Git, Visual Studio, and PyCharm for project management and development.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic studies, I have gained valuable work experience as a customer service representative at Technoso, a leading company in the field of control systems. There, I provided technical support and solutions to customers through various interfaces, such as phone, email, and web. I also used Node.js to develop and maintain internal tools and applications that enhanced customer satisfaction and efficiency. I am highly motivated, persistent, and excited by completing tasks in an optimal way. I am looking for a job that will expand my horizons and contribute to my education and experience in the software industry.</p>
